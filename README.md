# DataCamp_Data_Engineer_Software-Engineering_Principles_in_Python

Course Description <br />

Data scientists can experience huge benefits by learning concepts from the field of software engineering, allowing them to more easily reutilize their code and share it with collaborators. In this course, you'll learn all about the important ideas of modularity, documentation, & automated testing, and you'll see how they can help you solve Data Science problems quicker and in a way that will make future you happy. You'll even get to use your acquired software engineering chops to write your very own Python package for performing text analytics.

### 1. Software Engineering & Data Science

Why should you as a Data Scientist care about Software Engineering concepts? Here we'll cover specific Software Engineering concepts and how these important ideas can revolutionize your Data Science workflow!

- [ ] Python, data science, & software engineering
- [ ] The big ideas
- [ ] Python modularity in the wild
- [ ] Introduction to packages & documentation
- [ ] Installing packages with pip
- [ ] Leveraging documentation
- [ ] Conventions and PEP 8
- [ ] Using pycodestyle
- [ ] Conforming to PEP 8
- [ ] PEP 8 in documentation

### 2. Writing a Python Module

Become a fully fledged Python package developer by writing your first package! You'll learn how to structure and write Python code that you can be installed, used, and distributed just like famous packages such as NumPy and Pandas.

- [ ] Writing your first package
- [ ] Minimal package requirements
- [ ] Naming packages
- [ ] Recognizing packages
- [ ] Adding functionality to packages
- [ ] Adding functionality to your package
- [ ] Using your package's new functionality
- [ ] Making your package portable
- [ ] Writing requirements.txt
- [ ] Installing package requirements
- [ ] Creating setup.py
- [ ] Listing requirements in setup.py

### 3. Utilizing Classes

Object Oriented Programming is a staple of Python development. By leveraging classes and inheritance your Python package will become a much more powerful tool for your users.

- [ ] Adding classes to a package
- [ ] Writing a class for your package
- [ ] Using your package's class
- [ ] Adding functionality to classes
- [ ] Writing a non-public method
- [ ] Using your class's functionality
- [ ] Classes and the DRY principle
- [ ] Using inheritance to create a class
- [ ] Adding functionality to a child class
- [ ] Using your child class
- [ ] Multilevel inheritance
- [ ] Exploring with dir and help
- [ ] Creating a grandchild class
- [ ] Using inherited methods

### 4. Maintainability

You've now written a fully functional Python package for text analysis! To make maintaining your project as easy as possible we'll leverage best practices around concepts such as documentation and unit testing.

- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Identifying good comments
- [ ] Identifying proper docstrings
- [ ] Writing docstrings
- [ ] Readability counts
- [ ] Using good function names
- [ ] Using good variable names
- [ ] Refactoring for readability
- [ ] Unit testing
- [ ] Using doctest
- [ ] Using pytest
- [ ] Documentation & testing in practice
- [ ] Documenting classes for Sphinx
- [ ] Identifying tools
- [ ] Final Thoughts
